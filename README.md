A project for an Object Oriented Programming class at NSCC. This console app is a calculator for rational numbers. Nothing too novel here, just some basic math operations, as well as operator overloads. This project contains an implementation of Euclid's Algorithm, for denominator reductions. The program does not follow order of operations, instead electing to view rationals as a single entity, meaning that entering '4/5/6/7' is interpreted as '(4/5)/(6/7)'.
